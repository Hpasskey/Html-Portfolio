<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  I'm playing cath up after leaving the corporate world for 2 decades.  Being in an IT field with a 
degree in computer science in the 90s, and having been left behind, careerwise, I have finally found 
the time and courage to go back to learning, updating and upgrading my skills.  I'm also planning to 
stick with this new adventure and make productive use of the skills I will gain in the process.

  My children are my priority and I would say that giving up work to take care of them was very rewarding 
and precious.  I have gained a lot of skills as a housewife and a mother. But now, I am being lead to do 
something for my personal growth not setting aside my family as they are still my priority.   
God's timing is perfect and in a discerning moment, I know I have to start somewhere.  So here it is! 
We don't really grow old trying to learn new things, we grow old when we quit trying.  So here I am, 
starting over and hopefully, by the end of this course, I will be prepared to plan the next step and 
actually apply the new skills and be productive.

  On the fun side of motherhood, my family loves going on road trips visiting many places.  Scenic drives 
are memorable.  We drove traversing the eastcoast from Florida to Maine.  Living in the Northeast was a 
choice because we enjoy the winter weather compared to hot and humid climate of Texas or Arizona.
  Staying at home stimulates creative juices as well as I often decorate every season and Christmas 
is my season!  Every Christmas, I have a different theme and I keep an album of my decors, most of them 
hand-made.  Fall is also my favorite because of the vibrant colors.  
  I also enjoy DIY-ing and decorating every room in our house.  I change each room tailored to each of 
my kid's personality.  
  Gardening is such a joy!  My kids learned to eat vegetables because I plant them...healthy and organic 
are a bonus.  Sharing my produce was also part of the joy gardening brings.  In the process, landscaping is 
an acquired skill.
  Some other hobbies I enjoy doing include:  fashion designing and sewing, soft-furnishings, converting old
furniture into something utilitarian like old beds into shelves, chairs, etc., recycling and re-purposing 
stuff, making hypertufa pots, cooking, baking, DIY-ing almost everything in the house and much more...
I just realized I have learned so much on this side of life.  Oh what Fun!
